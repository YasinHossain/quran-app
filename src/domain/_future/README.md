# Future Domain Features

This directory contains domain entities and logic for features planned for future implementation.

## Grammar Research Features (Phase 3 - Future)

- **Grammar.ts** - Complete grammar analysis domain entity
- **IGrammarRepository.ts** - Grammar data persistence interface

### When to Implement:
- After 70% core functionality is complete
- When adding advanced research features
- For academic/scholarly use cases

### Integration Steps:
1. Move entities back to main `entities/` folder
2. Move repository interfaces back to `repositories/` folder
3. Update domain index exports
4. Implement infrastructure layer for grammar data
5. Create application services for grammar features

The architecture is designed to support seamless integration when ready.
