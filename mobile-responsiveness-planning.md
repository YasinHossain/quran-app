  - [x] ResponsiveImage component tests with performance validation
- [x] **Create comprehensive testing utilities** (`lib/__tests__/responsive-test-utils.ts`)
  - [x] Device simulation presets (iPhone SE, iPad, Desktop variants)
  - [x] `testResponsiveHook` for hook behavior across breakpoints
  - [x] `renderResponsive` for component testing with device switching
  - [x] Accessibility testing utilities (focus, touch targets, readability)
- [x] **Test component variants** at each breakpoint with automated assertions
- [x] **Performance testing tools** for layout shift and image loading

#### Task 3.2: Cross-Device Validation ✅ **COMPLETED**
