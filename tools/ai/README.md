# AI Tools

Utilities for generating code and tests using template-driven scaffolding.

- **feature-generator** – creates domain entities, repositories, controllers, and use cases with ready-to-use logic.
- **test-generator.mjs** – produces test files with Arrange/Act/Assert structure and example mocks.

These tools help keep generated code production-ready and consistent across the project.
