## Architecture

This project implements **Clean Architecture** with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles:

```
src/
├── domain/             # Business logic & entities
│   ├── entities/       # Core business objects
│   ├── services/       # Domain services
│   └── repositories/   # Repository interfaces
├── application/        # Use cases & application services
│   ├── use-cases/      # Business use cases
│   └── services/       # Application services
├── infrastructure/     # External services & implementations
│   ├── api/           # API clients and data sources
│   ├── repositories/  # Repository implementations
│   └── services/      # External service integrations
└── presentation/       # UI components (Atomic Design)
    ├── atoms/         # Basic UI elements
    ├── molecules/     # Compound components
    ├── organisms/     # Complex UI sections
    └── templates/     # Page layouts
```

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer boundaries with dependency inversion
- **Feature-based Organization**: Modular structure under `app/(features)/`
- **Atomic Design**: Systematic component hierarchy for UI consistency
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration throughout
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing strategy per layer

## AI-Enhanced Development

This project features an advanced **AI-assisted development workflow** that sets it apart:

### Context-Aware AI System

- **Directory-specific `.ai` context files** provide precise development guidance
- **CLAUDE.md** comprehensive project documentation for AI assistants
- **AI workflow scripts** for automated feature generation and quality analysis

### Quick AI Workflow Helper

```bash
./ai-workflow.sh help       # Show all available AI workflow commands
./ai-workflow.sh quality    # Run quality analysis
./ai-workflow.sh feature <name> # Generate complete feature
./ai-workflow.sh analyze <file> # Analyze file for improvements
```

## Testing

Our testing strategy follows **layer-specific approaches** for comprehensive coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Allow real network requests (disable MSW)
JEST_ALLOW_NETWORK=1 npm run test

# Run with coverage (target: 80%+)
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests (via Storybook)
npm run storybook

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- path/to/test
```

### Testing Patterns

- **Domain Layer**: Unit tests for entities and services (isolated business logic)
- **Application Layer**: Integration tests for use cases with mocked repositories
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Integration tests with API mocking
- **Presentation Layer**: Component tests with React Testing Library and provider wrapping

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required for production:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.quran.com/api/v4  # Quran API endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="Quran App"                  # App display name
NODE_ENV=production                               # Environment
NEXT_DISABLE_PWA=false                           # PWA toggle
```

### Data Management

Update Quran metadata:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/fetchData.ts  # Downloads latest juz data to data/juz.json
```

### Development Pages

Experimental pages under `app/(dev)` for local testing:

```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dev/player
```

### Custom Arabic Fonts

Add custom fonts to `public/fonts/` and configure in `app/providers/settingsStorage.ts`:

```ts
// Example font configuration
{ name: "My Font", value: '"My Font", serif', category: "Uthmani" }
```

- `name`: UI display label
- `value`: CSS `font-family` property
- `category`: Font tab grouping

**Important**: Only include fonts you're licensed to distribute. All font licenses are documented in [public/fonts/LICENSES.md](public/fonts/LICENSES.md).

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

Built with [`next-pwa`](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa) for offline Quran reading:

- **Automatic caching**: API responses, fonts, and static assets
- **Offline support**: Continue reading without internet connection
- **Service worker**: Active in production builds by default

```bash
# Disable PWA during build if needed
NEXT_DISABLE_PWA=true npm run build
```

### Development Tools

Built-in tooling for efficient development:

```bash
# Fast text search (works without system ripgrep)
npm run rg -- "use client" app lib

# List tracked files
npm run -s rg -- --files | head -n 20

# Component isolation with Storybook
npm run storybook  # Interactive component workbench
```

Optional system tools installation:

- macOS/Linux: `scripts/install-cli-tools.sh`
- Windows: `scripts/install-cli-tools.ps1`

Installs: `ripgrep`, `fd`, `jq`, `tree`

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

- Environment variables configured
- PWA service worker enabled
- All tests passing (`npm run check`)
- Bundle analysis completed (`npm run analyze`)

[See complete deployment guide →](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
